# Well, hello! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Invise Labs is a division of [Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com/). **We're a team of IT professionals who fly by night as computer programmers ‚Äì well, not anymore, but we were**, things are a bit more serious now in comparison to back in the day, when we started in November 2016.

**We primarily create software for IT Pros and Cyber Security Pros**, we're paving the way for exciting new technological software inventions inspired by our every day IT business, our malware hunting, and in addition to the endless possiblities we think of every day.

Through our day-to-day business we come up with all sorts of ideas for coding and automating things, if something works it's way into being a project, you'll find it here at Invise Labs. If it's not project worthy, you'll likely find it (scripts or other small trinkets) over at our [Invise Solutions Github page](https://github.com/invisesolutions/).

# Donations
We are asking our supporters, people who believe in us, and those who want to see our projects succeed, to please consider making a donation to support development. We don't mind giving lifetime subscriptions in exchange - for projects that we eventually will be charging for. It costs money to run developement, pay for servers such as Google Cloud instances, and pay ourselves if we will be spending enough personal time. A dedicated project donations page will be created soon, in the meantime, you can use our [pay page at Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com/pay).
