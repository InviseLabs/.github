# Well, hello! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Invise Labs is a division of [Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com/). **We're a team of IT professionals who fly by night as computer programmers ‚Äì well, not anymore, but we were**, things are a bit more serious now in comparison to back in the day, when we started in November 2016.

**We primarily create software for IT Pros and Cyber Security Pros**, we're paving the way for exciting new technological software inventions inspired by our every day IT business, our malware hunting, and the endless possiblities we think of every day.

Through our day-to-day business we come up with all sorts of ideas for coding and automating things, if something works it's way into being a project, you'll find it here at Invise Labs. If it's not project worthy, you'll likely find it (scripts or other small trinkets) over at our [Invise Solutions Github page](https://github.com/invisesolutions/).

# Donations
We are asking our supporters, people who believe in us, and those who want to see our projects succeed, to please consider making a donation to support development. We don't mind giving lifetime subscriptions in exchange - for projects that we eventually will be charging for. It costs money to run developement, pay for servers such as Google Cloud instances, and pay ourselves if we will be spending enough personal time. A dedicated project donations page will be created soon, in the meantime, you can use our [pay page at Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com/pay).

# Featured Projects üíΩ
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Dagger
Built for IT Pros to detect problems with computer systems. **Featuring Nexgen**, break-through malware detection algorithm and machine learning to detect malicious files on a Windows Operating System.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RMM Prober Scripts
See also: https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts
A collection of deployable Windows-based command-line scripts designed to output concerning or important hardware or sensor info; eg. HDD SMART, HW Temps, packet drops, etc. Each tool outputs the associated raw troubleshooting values, along with a PASS or FAIL and proper exit codes. Use with RMM or IT Admin software to alert you when a script check fails. Tested with SyncroMPS and Solarwinds MSP RMM dashboards, but should work with any RMM dashboard that allows running remote scripts and checking output / exit codes. These scripts are ready to upload to your RMM dashboard and by default deloy into the C:\IT folder.

[TempProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-TempProber): Uses OpenHardwareMonitor API to collect and display HW temps along with a PASS or FAIL next to each deployed PC.

[SMARTProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-SMARTProber): Displays HDD/SSD SMART data (pwr on hrs, current pending sectors, etc) with PASS or FAIl of SSDs / HDDs next to each deployed PC.

[DeviceProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-DeviceProber): Scans Device Manager information and reports any devices or drivers with a Warning, Failure, or Missing status attached to them. E.g. sisplays "x devices OK, x MISSING drivers" next to deployed PCs.

[NICProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-NICProber): Reports ethernet adapter connection speed status as 1gbps or 100mbps, which can assist you in troubleshooting network performance or watch for clients that attempt to use old cables or obsolete hardware.

[ConnectivityProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-ConnectivityProber): (Name might change.) Pings Google, or another server of your choice for 50 packets. Reports latency issues, average ms, jitter, and dropped packets. Displays status info next to each deployed PC.

[FanProber](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts-FanProber) **(COMING SOON)** Pulls fan speed info, attempts to detect operational issue of the fans, such as intermittent stopping, problematic RPM.
