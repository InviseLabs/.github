# Well, hello! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Invise Labs is a division of [Invise Solutions IT Services](https://invisesolutions.com/). **We primarily maintain a growing number of free projects and programs geared towards use by those in technology fields, including cyber cecurity pros**. We're paving the way for exciting new technological inventions inspired by [Mike](https://github.com/MNLierman), our every day IT business [Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com), our malware hunting, and the endless possiblities we think of every day.

**So who exactly are we?** We're a team of IT professionals who fly by night as computer programmers ‚Äì well, not anymore, but we were, things are a bit more serious now in comparison to back in the day, when Invise Labs started in November 2016.

Through our day-to-day business we come up with all sorts of ideas for coding and automating things, if something works it's way into being a project, you'll find it here at Invise Labs. If it's too small to be a project, you'll likely find it (scripts or other small trinkets) over at our [Invise Solutions Github page](https://github.com/invisesolutions/).

**üëâüèºüëâüèº [QuickDag / Nexgen Combined Repo](https://github.com/InviseLabs/QuickDag-Nexgen-Public/):** *(Formally Quick Dagger)* Our premier flagship project, forged from **over 7** years of relentless dedication and developement. This repo provides info about latest releases, project roadmaps, public bugs and feedback board, Discord info, etc.

If you plan on using, forking, or modifying our code, please read our simple Public Use License, by clinking the link above. Basic summary: Unless otherwise stated, any open source code that we release is released under our simple Invise Labs Public License, which permits unlimited usage for all types of uses, excluding for-profit commericial use, in which case you need to contact us to make an agreement. We spend a significant amount of time coding and creating our projects, so please be respectful and contact us if you want to include our work in for-profit applications or products. Some of our projects ***may***  not be fully open source, and their usage may be bound to terms for frequent users such as cheap subscription levels - **if** such a decision is made for a particular project, then we try to be extremely fair, as no one likes paying thousands per month for various subscriptions. Refer to the license or subscription info that came with that project.


# Donations
We are asking our supporters, people who believe in us, and those who want to see our projects succeed, to please consider making a donation to support development. We don't mind giving lifetime subscriptions in exchange - for projects that we eventually will be charging for. It costs money to run developement, pay for servers such as Google Cloud instances, and pay ourselves (to cover living costs) if we will be spending a lot of personal time. A dedicated project donations page will be created soon, in the meantime, you can use our [pay page at Invise Solutions](https://invisesolutions.com/pay).
